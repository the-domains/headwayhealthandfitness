## I believe in individuality and authenticity. None of us is better than all of us. We all deserve to find our own starting point on the road to health and fitness. 

## I believe excuse and physical limitations are different. Changing your mindset toward diet and exercise can be a very liberating experience. It's not all about spandex and restrictive eating. 
There is no limit. Today will be better than yesterday and tomorrow is an opportunity to take the next step. 

## Believe you can, and you will! No one is too old, too heavy, too broken to start. Free you mind of can't, and you will find you can.
